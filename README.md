This project is all about creating a small 2D game. Working with sprites, events and all about that


all i've got now is just a simple window rendering and a string that is being printed on the window
and being cleared on a specific pressed key


what I need to do next:
1. texture rendering -> thats is walls, collectable, enemies and entrance
2. texture moving -> in this case its just a player sprite that is going to be moiving in 4 directions
3. collisions
4. map rendering -> which is going to be loading a map from a file and then printing textures above on specific order
    for example map can look like this

0 -> empty space
1 -> wall
C -> collectible
E -> map exit
P -> player's starting point, when moving character this position will be changed too
